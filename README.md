# SmsPOST
 Auto Forward incoming SMS to any API
 
 An excellent use case for this application is
 1. In automations where SMS/OTP authentication is required. E.g. Flipkart login, COWIN Login

Requires an API at the receiving end. I will be publishing a basic one in the future which can be deployed on IIS or using Powershell.
